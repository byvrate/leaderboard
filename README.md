# PRESTIGE Leaderboard
A Strava segment time aggretator and leaderboard tool that lists athletes by their fastest times.

## Getting Started
There is currently no tool just yet since, but in development. Check back soon for updates. There does exist Postman web requests to help define some of the more intereseting Strave APIs for consideration in the development of this tool. There's also a [specification](SPEC.md) that defines in more detail about what this tool does as well as the in inputs and outputs and results. 

## Prerequisites
At this time there are no prerequisites. It's under consideration on wether this tool will be a simple web based form or a console application or both. If you wish to run the [Postman web requests](postman/Strava.postman_collection.json) you can download the tool from the [Postman download site](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) and then import the [Strava.postman_collection.json](postman/Strava.postman_collection.json) web requests.

## Technical Architecture
This is stil under consideration. Some of the factors include cross- platform, end-user usage, simplicity, scale, and price.
